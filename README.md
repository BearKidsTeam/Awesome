Why do this:
---
The goal is build an alternaive web app for my original stuff-sharing static website.

Deps:
---
 - django // OF COURSE WE NEED THIS
 - whitenoise // static files storage
 - markdown // for parsing markdown text to html
 - BeautifulSoup // for convert html to plain text

FAQ:
---
 - Site preview?  
 [Here you are](http://blumia.pythonanywhere.com/). I don't promise code which this site using is always the same as this repo
 - License?  
 No idea, since this site is still under construction, leave a license after it has a stable release is better
 - What you call a three humps camel?  
 I don't know
 - Seriously, Will this repo finally have a stable release?  
 I don't know. really.
